    If true the digitizer will be configured by pulselib.

    measurement time in ns.

    Channels to retrieve data from specified by name.

    '''
    Sample rate of data in Hz. When not None, the data should not be averaged,
    but downsampled with specified rate. Useful for time traces and Elzerman readout.
    Downsampling uses block average.
